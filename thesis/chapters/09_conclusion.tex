\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

This work, surveyed numerous offline and online algorithms for fractional and integral smoothed convex optimization in single and high dimensions. We evaluated the performance of online algorithms for the application of dynamically right-sizing data centers using traces from various different sources. We found that the discussed online algorithms perform nearly optimally with respect to the observed normalized cost when compared to the dynamic offline optimum. Moreover, we observed that the normalized cost achieved by the online algorithms is robust to changes in the data center model but generally increases as the potential cost savings increase. In our experiments, changes in the data center model such as increasing the energy cost or decreasing the normalized switching cost lead to significant increases in cost savings. We also observed that the difference between fractional and integral solutions is negligible in the application of right-sizing data centers. Further, we discussed how algorithms can use predictions of future loads.

Finally, we made our implementation of the discussed algorithms available. This implementation can be used easily to test the performance in other applications and to compare the performance between algorithms. Our data center model balances energy cost and revenue loss. It can easily be tuned using past data to be safe (i.e., provide enough computing resources for incoming loads), fulfill service level agreements, and provide significant cost savings.
