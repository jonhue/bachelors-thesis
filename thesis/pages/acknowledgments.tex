I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Susanne Albers, for allowing me to work on this exciting topic. I would like to thank my advisor Jens Quedenfeld for his patient work on various drafts, checking my proofs, and his help whenever I felt stuck. I would like to thank the maintainer of pyo3, David Hewitt, for explaining the workings of threads at the intersection of Rust and Python and his great help with debugging the Python bindings. Especially, I would like to thank my friends and my family for their support and stimulating discussions on this and other topics.
